# PHP Practical Test

## Process to run the script


#### Clone the scrip

#### Change DB config in DBConnection.php file which is contain config folder

#### To see main categories with total item count hit YOUR_HOSTcontrollers/ShowMainCategories.php

#### To see category tree with total item count hit YOUR_HOSTcontrollers/ShowCategoriesTree.php

#### That's it!

### NB: I found total item count in item table is not same with item_category_relations table. That's why count will not be same in ShowMainCategories page with ShowCategoriesTree page.
